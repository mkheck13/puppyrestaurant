### Peer Review:

**Comments**: Overall the site looks great and is very accurate to the figma, the cards in the home page, about page, and catering have rounded corners, which should be changed to sharp corners just for finer attention to detail to the figma. There are some issues when it comes down to responsiveness that need to be addressed. The catering page transitions nicely into dropdowns for mobile, the problem is the text for each section kinda just hangs out randomly while the dropdowns only contain the images that were initially at the bottom of the page. The About page is mostly responsive for mobile and tablet, but the first card containing the text does not align centered with the first image of the page on tablet, then on mobile that same image doesn't shrink at all which causes some overflow. Also on the about page, the container with the title "Our Team" is not centered on neither mobile or tablet which causes overflow on both screen widths.  The screen width brings me to one of my main points, the responsiveness is not consistent. The entire Catering page is perfectly responsive on the screen width of 768px, then breaks entirely on 767px. The entire Photos page is not responsive at 768px, then becomes responsive at 767px. All the cards under Our Team in the About section is also not responsive on the screen width of 768px but become responsive at 767px. Small nitpick of the photos section would be that the responsiveness on mobile would be fine but since there is a space between the images at the start of each row, there should be some space between each individual picture as well. Another nitpick is on the About section, the first card of the page and the cards under Our Team for mobile are not centered.
